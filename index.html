       <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Having over 11 years of Management experience and a little over 7 years of Marketing experience under his belt, David has climbed the corporate ladder in Fortune 500 companies such as ABM, Starbucks, 7 Leaves Cafe, Dunkin Donuts and King Taco.<br/>

            He went back to college after he hit a glass ceiling in the corporate world when higher positions started requesting that he had the proper certifications and degrees to advance. He then pursued Business at Santa Monica College where he obtained certifications in both MANAGEMENT/LEADERSHIP as well as MARKETING. Having been intrigued more with Marketing, he took a Udemy Digital Marketing course and Google Digital Marketing & E-commerce course where he was also certified for both courses.<br/>
            After leaving the corporate world he went on to assist his father and best friend with Digital Marketing efforts for their businesses. While running Descry, he was recruited by digital media and events group 6AM to assist with their event marketing and eventually led to also overseeing the e-commerce store of their apparel line Shop by 6AM. Between that time, he was helping event curators such as REVOLT, Veluda and Madhouse advance with their online marketing efforts.<br/>
            David has an expansive knowledge of business but he specializes mostly in Management and Marketing where he helps people organize and maximize the full potential of their businesses.<br/>
